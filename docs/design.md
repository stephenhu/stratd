# turn based strategy backend engine

this engine can be used for various time periods, both historical anf fantastical, flexibility in altering the story line, but fairly prescriptive when you get down to battle mode.  basically a user controls a country and fights against other countries for territory and dominance.  there can be diplomacy.  maps are fixed and run until everyone quits or there's one person standing, these maps can last many years, so lobg as it's active.

## maps

'+ means this is a relative attribute'


## notes

* technology shouldnt be constantly evolving making battles, strategy, and experience more important, should be a much more gradual approach, focus on battles and preparation for battles
* economy should be based on cities and population, shouldnt require mining resources like starcraft
* each faction should have different attributes like populations, income, army competence
* what should the multiplayer angle be since this is turn based, some players will block the whole game's progress?  perhaps if users dont progress then a default set of actions will be enacted
