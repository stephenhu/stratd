# turn based strategy backend engine

this engine can be used for various time periods, both historical and fantastical, flexibility in altering the story line, but fairly prescriptive when you get down to battle mode.  basically a user controls a faction or country and fights against other factions for territory and dominance.  there can be diplomacy.  maps are fixed and run until everyone quits or there's one person standing, these maps can last many years, so long as it's active.


## gameplay

* several aspects: battle preparation and battle

### battle preparation

there will be some level of preparation needed for battle, a user could go into battle without any preparation, but will have very little chance of success

* unit training
* supply and funding
* supply line
* marching to attack area
* scouting, intelligence gathering
* unit organization
* leadership selection
* diplomacy
* policy
* strategy

if the user is defending then preparation could consist of:

* fortifications
* traps

battle preparation will be a very important aspect of the game, careful consideration may decide the outcome of the game, a more superior force may be destroyed by a lesser force, a force with more people may also be destroyed by a smaller force, these are all posibilities so planning is critical

### battles

users will play the overall commander and will have full omniscient view and control over

* chain of command, including organization
* troop arrangement
* orders
* assessment of current
* tracking of progress
* fortifications can be created
* intelligence gathering
* care of injured

## maps

* squares or polygons
* terrain such as mountains, plains, hills, water
* fog of war, but special intelligence can provide some predictionse
* random generation
* varying sizes

## units

* age
* rank
* specialty type, e.g. horse, gun, infantry, medic
* hitpoints
* intelligence
* strength
* vision
* charisma
* dexterity
* experience

* psychological
* luck
* loyalty +
* morale
* speed
* health

* communication

'+ means this is a relative attribute'


## notes

* technology shouldnt be constantly evolving making battles, strategy, and experience more important, should be a much more gradual approach, focus on battles and preparation for battles
* economy should be based on cities, industries, and population, shouldnt require manually mining resources like starcraft, this should something that happens in the background
* each faction should have different attributes like populations, income, army competence
* what should the multiplayer angle be since this is turn based, some players will block the whole game's progress?  perhaps if users dont progress within a certain time, then a default set of actions will be enacted
* hero units will appear over time since all units have varying degrees of ability, it is up to the user to recognize these units and promote them or develop them, there will be an additional intangible field for each unit which adds some increase in abilities
