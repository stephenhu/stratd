# turn based strategy backend engine

this engine can be used for various time periods, both historical and fantastical, flexibility in altering the story line, but fairly prescriptive when you get down to battle mode.  basically a user controls a faction or country and fights against other factions for territory and dominance.  there can be diplomacy.  maps are fixed and run until everyone quits or there's one person standing, these maps can last many years, so long as it's active.


## gameplay

* several aspects: battle preparation and battle

### battle preparation

there will be some level of preparation needed for battle, a user could go into battle without any preparation, but will have very little chance of success

* unit organization
* leadership selection
* diplomacy
* policy

if the user is defending then preparation could consist of:

* fortifications
* traps

## notes

* technology shouldnt be constantly evolving making battles, strategy, and experience more important, should be a much more gradual approach, focus on battles and preparation for battles
* economy should be based on cities, industries, and population, shouldnt require manually mining resources like starcraft, this should something that happens in the background
* each faction should have different attributes like populations, income, army competence
* what should the multiplayer angle be since this is turn based, some players will block the whole game's progress?  perhaps if users dont progress within a certain time, then a default set of actions will be enacted
* heroes will appear over time since all units have varying degrees of ability, it is up to the user to recognize these units and promote them or develop them
