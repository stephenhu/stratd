## notes

* technology shouldnt be constantly evolving making battles, strategy, and experience more important, should be a much more gradual approach, focus on battles and preparation for battles
* economy should be based on cities and population, shouldnt require mining resources like starcraft
* each faction should have different attributes like populations, income, army competence
* what should the multiplayer angle be since this is turn based, some players will block the whole game's progress?  perhaps if users dont progress then a default set of actions will be enacted
