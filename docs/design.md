# turn based strategy backend engine

this engine can be used for various time periods, both historical and fantastical, flexibility in altering the story line, but fairly prescriptive when you get down to battle mode.  basically a user controls a faction or country and fights against other factions for territory and dominance.  there can be diplomacy.  maps are fixed and run until everyone quits or there's one person standing, these maps can last many years, so long as it's active.


## gameplay

* several aspects: battle preparation and battle

### battle preparation

there will be some level preparation needed for battle, a user could go into battle, but will have very little chance of success

* unit training
* supply and funding
* supply line
* marching to attack area
* scouting, intelligence gathering
* unit organization
* leadership selection
* diplomacy
* policy
* strategy

if it's a defensive preparation then it could the following

* fortifications
* traps

### battles

users will play the overall commander and will have full omniscient view for his units

* troop arrangement
* orders
* assessment of current
* tracking of progress
* fortifications can be created

## maps

* squares or polygons
* terrain such as mountain, plains, hills
* fog of war, but special intelligence can provide some predictionse
* random generation
* varying sizes

## units

* rank
* specialty type, e.g. horse, gun, infantry, medic
* hitpoints
* intelligence
* strength
* vision
* charisma
* dexterity
* experience
* endurance
* luck
* loyalty +
* morale
* speed
* health
* recovery
* discipline
* communication
* obey
* strategy
* respect +
* knowledge

'+ means this is a relative attribute'


## notes

* technology shouldnt be constantly evolving making battles, strategy, and experience more important, should be a much more gradual approach, focus on battles and preparation for battles
* economy should be based on cities and population, shouldnt require mining resources like starcraft
* each faction should have different attributes like populations, income, army competence
* what should the multiplayer angle be since this is turn based, some players will block the whole game's progress?  perhaps if users dont progress then a default set of actions will be enacted
